# Flame effect
Implementation of plasma effect in javascript.

## What is this?
I really like various graphical effects used in demos created for the demoscene events. In this project I implemented a well-known effect called fire or flames.

## What are the features?
You will see a fire animation in the web browser. When you move the mouse pointer over the effect, it will change the flames real in the animation. 

## What are Future Plans for this Project?
* Additional, more sophisticated and realistic color calculations
* Interactivity so that the visual appearance like colors and animation speed of the flames can be changed in realtime. This should be done by introducing a menu

## How can I try it?
Demo: https://nlharri.github.io/thecodinghype/gfx-flames/index.html

## How does it work?
Javascript code using HTML5 canvas.
